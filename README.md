JavaScript Object Methods Demo
Overview
This simple web app demonstrates the use of various JavaScript object methods. It's designed to help beginners understand how to manipulate and interact with objects in JavaScript. The app showcases methods such as for...in, Object.keys(), Object.values(), and the spread operator (...).

Features
Property Iteration: Using for...in to loop over object properties.
Object Keys and Values: Demonstrating Object.keys() and Object.values() to extract object keys and values.
Object Length Calculation: Utilizing Object.keys() to determine the number of properties in an object.
Object Merging: Merging two objects using the spread operator.
How It Works
The app consists of an HTML page (index.html) that links to a JavaScript file (script.js). When the page is loaded in a web browser, the JavaScript code executes and displays the results of various operations on JavaScript objects.

HTML Structure
The HTML file contains a simple structure with a title and a div element where the JavaScript output is displayed.

JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript file defines a sample object and performs several operations, displaying the results on the HTML page. It covers different aspects of object manipulation, such as iterating over properties, merging objects, and extracting keys and values.

How to Use
Viewing the Demo: Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the demo.
Exploring the Code: Look through the script.js file to understand the JavaScript code and the object methods being used.
